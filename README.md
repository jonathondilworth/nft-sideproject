# OWNLY.art

*For the time being, this is simply a side project.*

OWNLY.art is a marketplace for exchanging 'Non Fungible Tokens' and other types of on-chain assets in interesting (and potentially novel) ways.

The marketplace will primarily use Laravel (and all the components that come packaged there-in) in addition to NGINX and is planned to be deployed on Ubuntu 20.x LTS.
